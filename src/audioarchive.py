'''Include comments at the top of each file that clearly say  what each file does.
Note that you may structure your code so that it is separated into
multiple files (i.e. modules), but that is not required.

Remember, if you are splitting your files into multiple modules, you will need to make sure to use
this convention:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Do something here
