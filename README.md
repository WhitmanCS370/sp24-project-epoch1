# Group Project: Epoch 1
### Due Sunday, February 18, 2024

In Epoch 1, you will create software in Python that allows users to browse the sounds and play them back. This repository contains:
* A set of sample audio files (in .wav format), in the sounds directory
* Suggested ways to format your code, i.e. in a src directory and a test directory -- with sample python files for you to fill in.

## Functional requirements:
* A user should be able to interact with your program from the command line via a simple text-based interface.
* From that command-line interface, the user should be able to get a list of available commands.
* A user should be able to get a list of available sounds to play.
* A user should be able to play back a single sound.
* A user should be able to listen to multiple sounds simultaneously (i.e., layer multiple sounds on top of each other).
* A user should be able to listen to a sequence of sounds.
* A user should be able to rename a sound.

## Implementation requirements:
* You should write this program in Python using the simpleaudio package. You can assume that your user (in this case, Profs. Wirfs-Brock and Davis, who will be running your code) already have simpleaudio installed.
* Your program should, at minimum, be able to play .wav audio files.
* Your code should be well-commented.
* All of your code should be contained in a single GitHub repository.

## Documentation requirements:
* Along with your code, your GitHub repository needs to include a README file.
* The README file should include all team-member names as well as a short summary of each person's contributions.
* The README should also include instructions for how to run your command-line interface (i.e., a first sample command to enter to get additional instructions, some sample command-line instruction examples).
* Your README should also include a short statement about how you tested your code.
* Your README should also include a short reflection that includes (a) any challenges you encountered and how you tackled them, (b) how you anticipate modifying/changing your code in the future.

## Grading criteria:
* Meets expectations: Project contains complete code that meets stated functional requirements and runs  without errors. GitHub repositiory contains all necessary elements.
* Exceeds expectations: Code shows exemplary organization (i.e. use of modules), exemplary testing (i.e. contains unit tests), or additional features.
