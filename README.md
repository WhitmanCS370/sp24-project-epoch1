# Group Project: Epoch 1
### Due Sunday, February 18, 2024

In Epoch 1, you will create software in Python that allows users to browse the sounds and play them back. This repository contains:
* A set of sample audio files (in .wav format), in the sounds
* Suggested ways to format your cde, i.e. in a src folder, with a main.py file.



(These are your tentative requirements, with more detail to come.) Your sound archive should have a text-based command line interface that allows a user to:
See a list of available commands (i.e., what can I do?)
See a list of available sounds
Play back a single sound
Listen to multiple sounds simultaneously (i.e., layer multiple sounds on top of each other)
Listen to a sequence of sounds
Rename a sound
